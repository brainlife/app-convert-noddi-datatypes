# Temporary converter app from NODDI-deprecated to NODDI datatype

This app will This app is purely designed for use within brainlife as it converts a deprecated NODDI datatype to the newer version. Specifically, the biggest change between the two datatypes is the naming schema employed with icvf => ndi and od => odi, to match the more commonly used acronyms

## Running the App

### On Brainlife.io

You can submit this App online at [https://doi.org/https://doi.org/10.25663/brainlife.app.368](https://doi.org/https://doi.org/10.25663/brainlife.app.368) via the 'Execute' tab.

### Running Locally (on your machine)

1. git clone this repo

2. Inside the cloned directory, create `config.json` with something like the following content with paths to your input files.

```json
{
	"dir": "/input/noddi/dir.nii.gz",
	"icvf": "/input/noddi/icvf.nii.gz",
	"od": "/input/noddi/od.nii.gz",
	"isovf": "/input/noddi/isovf.nii.gz"
}
```

### Sample Datasets

You can download sample datasets from Brainlife using [Brainlife CLI](https://github.com/brain-life/cli). 

```
npm install -g brainlife
bl login
mkdir input
bl dataset download
```

3. Launch the App by executing 'main'

```bash
./main
```

## Output

The main output of this App is a noddi datatype, containing the neurite density index (ndi), orientation dispersion index (odi), and isotropic volume fraction (isovf) data.

#### Product.json

The secondary output of this app is `product.json`. This file allows web interfaces, DB and API calls on the results of the processing.

### Dependencies

This App only requires [singularity](https://www.sylabs.io/singularity/) to run. If you don't have singularity, you just need a terminal with a "cp" command.
